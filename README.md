# Cassadmin

## Cassandra distributed database web-based admin.

To get your web app running, type these following commands:

        sudo bundle install
        sudo bundle update

If you are still having issues about the thrift-client gem complaining that it doesn't fit with the cassandra gem, you can edit directly the cassandra gem and fix the appropriate thrift-client gem.
